**STEP 1: GENERATING IDEAS**
1. Apps that take user input text and runs it through Perspective AI https://support.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-sample-requests?language=en_US to see if the text is toxic or not. Mental health app so you don't send rude messages. - **Megan** Alternative API that works with kotlin https://rapidapi.com/unicornNLP/api/profanity-toxicity-detection-for-user-generated-content
2. Event based app similar to seatGeek or Ticket Master
- http://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/
- https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api/ **Kristen**
3. Travel based API - flights offer api(https://apilist.fun/api/flight-offer-search) **Yasaman**
4. Trivia Game https://www.codu.co/articles/5-free-trivia-api-s-to-create-your-own-quiz-app-eoui-a7i. use Trivia APIs to create a trivia game. Check user answers and assign points and streaks. - **Megan**
5. Movies Information App https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/ - **Fay**
6. Receiving calls from strange phone number? https://rapidapi.com/larroyouy70/api/phonenumbervalidatefree/ - **Fay**
7. Traveler App: https://rapidapi.com/MeteosourceWeather/api/ai-weather-by-meteosource/
Location: https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/
https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/ip-geo-location/
Accomodation:
https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/airbnb19/
Tourist attractions:
https://rapidapi.com/opentripmap/api/places1/ - **Fay**
8. Random News app: https://mediastack.com/. Use API to generate random news articles, or let user select types of articles they want to recieve and show them three at a time. This could help the user reduce stress reading the news because they would only see three articles at a time and wouldn't have to choose between hundreds. - **Megan**
9. Get some text from user and generate image using this api(https://monsterapi.ai/playground/txt2img) - **Yasaman**
10. Questions from user to guess the name of the song from lyrics and if it was correct play the music for them then go to next question using this api(https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation?ref=apilist.fun) - Yasaman
11. Object Detection from Images (https://api-ninjas.com/api/objectdetection) - **Yasaman**
12. Translation API App (https://libretranslate.com/) - **Rachel**
13. Currency Conversion API (https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/) - **Rachel**
14. Something involving two API's would be nice - perhaps using Perspective API to parse through incoming text and then using another to provide a suggested response to text (https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/smart-reply/android) This api may be hard because it requires a Android API lvl 19 or higher to work - **Rachel**
15. Horoscope API that upon user input retreives birth details and zodiac predicitions **Kristen**
- https://www.astrologyapi.com/horoscope-api-docs/api-ref/75/sun_sign_prediction/daily/:zodiacName
16. Water Quality API - Based on neighboring area, could provide information on the water quality of nearby water bodies. **Kristen**

**STEP 2: EVALUATING TOP 3 IDEAS**

*Criteria:*

a. Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?

What makes your app more than a glorified website?

b. Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?

How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?

c. Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?

What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?

d. Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?

How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
Does an average user just consume your app, or do they use it to create something?

e. Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?

How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the deadline?
Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
How clearly defined is the product you want to build?





|  |  IDEA#14   | IDEA#1 | IDEA#8 |
| -------- | --- | -------- | -------- |
| Mobile   |  Texting is done mostly on a mobile device, so a tool to parse and respond would be most helpful when on a mobile device.   | Texing is done mostly on a mobile device, so a tool to assess texts before they are sent would be most helpful on a mobile device.         | Often we are on our phones first thing in the morning before a computer, and many people like to read the news when they wake up, so making it an app would make sense.         |
| Story    | This app would promote productivity. Auto generating a text response can reduce the time it takes for people to reply to emails and messages while maintaining politeness.     | Have you ever regretted sending that drunk or angry text? Did you ever not realize how your message sounded? Toxic Texter will assess the toxicity of your text before you hit send.         |This app would reduce decision fatigue. Everyday there is so many news stories, many of them depressing. Random news app would only show you three at a time of the catagories you select to reduce the mental strain of visiting a news site.          |
| Market     | 13+ people who text    | Adults and teens struggling with their mental health or temperment (or anyone idk)        |  Adults and teens who are interested in the news, politics, or related topics        |
| Habit         | Probably habit forming only in the sense that it is convenient.    | Probably habit forming only in the sense that it is helpful.          | Maybe habit forming because it would be helpful but idk         |
| Scope     |The uses for this app would be very broad. Our project is not yet well defined.     | It seems like the APIs for this might be complicated.    |    The app is pretty simple and has one use, display three news articles at a time.      |


Therefore, our **Final Decision** is: 
Morning Mosaic: After looking at the API's, we decided to combine two of our ideas and create a Random News App with a Horoscope. It would be a morning app for people to wake up, look at their horoscope, and see some news while they are starting their day. This app could appeal to a wide variety of people, maybe those who miss the old newspaper experience of having different columns next to eachother. The two API's for the news and the horoscope seem pretty straightforward to use, and even if we get half of the project working, it will work for our assignment.
